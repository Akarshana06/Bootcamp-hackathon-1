# 🚨 AI Legal Clause Summarizer

This project is about building an **AI “digital lawyer”** that helps normal users understand long and confusing **Terms & Conditions** before they click “Accept”.

Most people never read these documents, but they often contain:
- Hidden **auto-renewal** charges  
- **Non-refundable** payments  
- **Third-party** data sharing (selling or sharing your data)  
- **Arbitration** clauses that make it harder to sue

The goal is to **scan that fine print** and clearly show what is risky for the user.


## ✅ What I Learned So Far (For Today)

Today’s focus was on **understanding the project idea**, not on coding:

- Understood the **problem**: people accept Terms & Conditions without knowing the risks.  
- Understood the **solution**: an AI tool that:
  - Scans T&C documents  
  - Highlights risky clauses with **Red/Yellow/Green** flags  
  - Answers specific questions by finding the right clauses  
  - Explains everything in **simple, clear language**

- Understood the **high-level tools** that will be used later:
  - **Next.js** for building the web app interface. 
  - **LangChain.js + LLMs** for analyzing and summarizing legal text.
